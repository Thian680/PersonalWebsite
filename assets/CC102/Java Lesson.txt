Java History

    Sun Microsystems:
        - James Gosling - Father of Java
        - Released in 1995 Java 1.0 (J2SE)
        - was then later obtained by Oracle.

        Various configs. for various platforms:
            J2EE - Enterprise Applications
            J2ME - Mobile Applications
            
            Was then later renamed:
                Java SE = Standard Edition (ok)
                Java EE = Enterprise Edition (usually paid)
                Java ME = Micro Edition (for small applications)

    Java's Mantra: Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)

    Key Features of Java:
        1. Object-Oriented: Everything in Java is an object, supporting easy extensibility.
        2. Platform Independent: Java compiles into platform-independent bytecode, which runs on any platform with JVM.
        3. Simple: Design to be easy to learn, especially for those familiar with OOP.
        4. Secure: Enables virus-free, tamper-free development using public-key encryption.
        5. Architecture-Neutral: Compiled code runs on many processors with Java runtime.
        6. Portable: NO implementation-dependent aspects; the compiler is written in ANSI C.
        7. Robust: Eliminates error-prone situations with extensive compile-time and runtime checks.
        8. Multithreaded: Allows simultaneous task executions for smooth, interactive applications.
        9. Interpreted: Bytecode is translated on-the-fly to native instructions.
        10. High Performance: Achieved through Just-In-Time(JIT) compilers.
        11. Distributed: Designed for distributed computing in the internet environment.
        12. Dynamic: Adapts to evolving environments, with extensive runtime information.

History:
    June 1991: Initiated by James Gosling for a set-top box project.
        - Initially called "Oak", later named "Green", and finally "Java".
